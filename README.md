Sombrero is a simple n-body simulator, written in C++, which enables users to 
simulate gravitational interactions between massive, spherical, rigid bodies. 
Sombrero is a command line tool, that generates a `.mp4` video of the simulation, 
given an initialisation file containing the initial states of the bodies. It was 
originally written for my, A-Level Computer Science project and has been 
expanded since. 

*Sombrero is currently under development, and is not in a finished state!*

Currently, Sombrero is capable of:
- Simulating **gravitational interactions** between non-rotating 
  spherical bodies.
- Simulating **collisions** between bodies.
  - *Right now, bodies can only merge upon impact, not split apart.*
  - *Whenever two bodies "collide", they will merge, regardless of 
    impact speed.*


## Getting Started
These instructions will get a copy of the project running on your local 
machine, for development and testing purposes.

> A `make install` command has not yet been implemented. The `make setup`
> command should be used to set up a self-contained development
> environment.
 
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need to make sure you have a few things installed 
to run and render simulations. On a UNIX (here Ubuntu) terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install -y make g++
```

### Compiling from source (Development)
To start using Sombrero, make sure you've installed the prerequisites then:

```
git clone https://github.com/tvarnish/sombrero.git
cd sombrero/
make setup
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine, create the necessary 
directories, and build the necessary files for running Sombrero.

## Basic Usage
Having followed the setup instructions, Sombrero can be run from within 
the `sombrero/` directory using the following command:

```
./sombrero
```

If no (or incorrect) arguments are supplied, a usage message will be displayed.

### Arguments
Initialisation files are supplied as follows:

```
-i [filepath]
```

where `[filepath]` is the path to a valid initialisation file. See the section 
on initialisation files for further information about these.

Currently, simple simulation parameters can be supplied using the `-s` and 
`-t` flags. The `-s` flag specifies the number of "frames" or "time steps" 
that the simulation should be run for. Each "frame" or "time step" will be 
equivalent to `-t` seconds. The argument passed via the `-s` flag should be 
an integer, and the argument passed via the `-t` flag should be an integer or 
a floating point number.

Use the `-h` or `--help` flags to display usage information.

### Example Simulation
An example initialisation file has been included with the repository. To run a 
simulation using this file, run the following command:
```
./sombrero -i init/realsolarsystem.csv -s 365 -t 86400
```

This command will simulate the inner planets of the solar system, over a 
period of 365 time-steps (`-s`), where each time step (`-t`) lasts 86400 
seconds (1 day).


## Initialisation Files
Initialisation files are comprised of a number of lines, each describing one 
'body' in the simulation. Each line must be written as follows (replacing the 
text in the example below with a numerical value, e.g. 5 or 4.0e10, etc.):

```
x_position, y_position, z_position, mass, radius, x_velocity, y_velocity, z_velocity, [object name]
```

Here, `[object name]` is an optional parameter which "labels" a body with a 
string identifier. This can be handy for keeping track of special objects in 
your simulations.

So, for example, if we were to have the Sun at the centre of the simulation 
(currently stationary), we could write:

```
0,0,0,1.989e30,6.955e8,0,0,0,Sun
```

### Comments
Comments can be written within initialisation files, using // to indicate the 
rest of the text on that line is a comment. For example:

```
0,0,0,1.989e30,6.955e8,0,0,0 // An example comment.
// Another example comment. This whole line is a comment.
```

It is also acceptable to place any whitespace characters (except a newline!) 
between each of the parameters and the commas, should you wish.


## Output
The output files generated by the software, are stored as 
`./data/bodyData_XX.csv`, where `XX` is the (zero-padded) "frame" number. 
These files follow the same structure as the initialisation files described 
above. However, these output files include an additional 
simulation-parameters line at the beginning of the file. 
This line is structured like so:

```
step_number, dt, time_elapsed, body_count
```

where, `step_number` is the number of integrations steps between this 
frame and the initial conditions (initialisation file). Hence, a value 
of `0` denotes that this file contains the initial starting conditions 
of the simulation. Here, `dt` is the time (in seconds) between 
subsequent integration steps (or "frames"), and `time_elapsed` is the 
total elapsed time (within the simulation, in seconds) since the start 
of the simulation (`step_number * dt`). Lastly, `body_count` is the 
number of bodies currently in the situation.
